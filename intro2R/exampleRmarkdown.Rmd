Starting the standard text that Rstudio provides when opening a new R notebook file (slightly edited):

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Material is organized into text (that's what this is) and code chunks (example below). When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing these chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Enter* or *Ctrl+Enter*. 

```{r}
4+5
```

```{r}
plot(1:10, 1:10)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can produce a document from the notebook, based on running all code chunks, by clicking the *Knit* button (*Cmd+Shift+K*).
